Exercise 01: Reverse Polish Notation
Exercise : 01
RPN
Turn-in directory : ex01/
Files to turn in : Makefile, main.cpp, RPN.{cpp, hpp}
Forbidden functions : None
You must create a program with these constraints:
• The program name is RPN.
• Your program must take an inverted Polish mathematical expression as an argu-
ment.
• The numbers used in this operation and passed as arguments will always be less
than 10. The calculation itself but also the result do not take into account this rule.
• Your program must process this expression and output the correct result on the
standard output.
• If an error occurs during the execution of the program an error message should be
displayed on the standard error.
• Your program must be able to handle operations with these tokens: "+ - / *".
You must use at least one container in your code to validate this
exercise.

C++ - Module 09 STL
You don’t need to handle brackets or decimal numbers.
Here is an example of standard usage:
$> ./RPN "8 9 * 9 - 9 - 9 - 4 - 1 +"
42
$> ./RPN "7 7 * 7 -"
42
$> ./RPN "1 2 * 2 / 2 * 2 4 - +"
0
$> ./RPN "(1 + 1)"
Error
$>
Warning: The container(s) you used in the previous exercise are
forbidden here. The container(s) you used to validate this exercise
will not be usable for the rest of this module.
